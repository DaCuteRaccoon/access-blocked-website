# How to Access Blocked Websites
In this quick tutorial I will show you how to access any blocked website you can think of, except for Google, which is really rare to have blocked by an admin or something.<br/><br/>
First, go to [Google](https://www.google.com/). Then, search for the website you want to go to. I'll use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) as an example.<br/>

Now, click on the three dots next to the URl.
